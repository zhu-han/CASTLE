## Boosting Cross-Domain Speech Recognition with Self-Supervision

This repository is the official implementation of the TASLP 2023 paper: [Boosting Cross-Domain Speech Recognition with Self-Supervision](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.09783.pdf)


## Example
- We provide an example with the SwitchBoard dataset in `run.sh`.
- The implementation is based on [fairseq](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/ee0d5a0f65a25e5f5372776402aac5cb9c4adbf1). Our modification is [here](https://github.com/zhu-han/CASTLE/commit/1cd57b15ba00f7b603d20dbdb58153192ffbf462).
