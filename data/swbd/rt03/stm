fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 51.47 52.84 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> RIGHT
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 71.08 77.45 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU I THINK THAT MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN REALLY SIMILAR
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 77.53 81.44 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> (%HESITATION) I AM A GRADUATE FROM U. T. SYSTEM AS WELL AND I THINK THAT
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 81.95 85.51 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> (%HESITATION) I I MY MAJOR MY CONCENTRATION WAS IN BUSINESS
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 85.61 92.11 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> AND MY EXPERIENCE WITH COMPUTERS (%HESITATION) A LOT OF (WHA-) (W-) OUR INTERACTION WAS
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 92.66 94.35 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> WAS PRIMARILY FORMULARY
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 94.56 103.33 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> AND IT WAS FOR CALCULUS AND SOLVING VARIOUS EQUATIONS AND WHILE IT IS DEFINITELY ADVANTAGEOUS TO UNDERSTAND THE PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE FORMULA
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 103.42 107.47 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> AND THE VARIOUS METHODOLOGIES USED IN BUSINESS
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 107.94 111.74 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> IT DID NOT SEEM TO ME TO MAKE A WHOLE LOT OF SENSE TO
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 111.97 114.72 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> HAVE TO MEMORIZE THESE FORMULAS JUST LIKE YOU
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 115.22 116.12 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> I I I THINK
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 116.21 120.04 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> YOU PROBABLY CARRIED AROUND A SCIENTIFIC CALCULATOR (%HESITATION) WE CERTAINLY CARRIED AROUND
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 120.19 123.56 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> BUSINESS CALCULATORS THAT PERFORMED THESE FUNCTIONS FOR US
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 123.8 127.24 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> AND IT AND IT IT DEFINITELY WAS NOT A DUMBING DOWN TOOL IT WAS
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 127.42 131.74 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> SOMETHING THAT ENHANCED OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 131.95 134.94 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> ADVANCED COMPUTATIONS IN A SHORTER AMOUNT OF TIME
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 135.2 137.68 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> BUT I THINK COMPUTERS AFFECT US IN THE SAME WAY
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 137.69 142.7 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> THEY ALLOW US THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACCOMPLISH MUCH MORE IN THE SAME WAY THAT CARS HAVE
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 142.87 144.31 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> OUTPACED PEOPLE
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 144.46 146.12 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> TRAVELING AND BY FOOT
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 146.68 148.42 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> I THINK COMPUTERS HAVE SORT OF OUT PACED
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 148.51 151.98 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> ALLOWED PEOPLE TO EXCEL BEYOND THEIR NORMAL CAPACITIES
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 152.19 154.31 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> FOR PERFORMING ADVANCED COMPUTATIONS OR

fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 161.46 162.08 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> SURE
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 166.63 167.63 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> OH RIGHT OKAY
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 180.77 186.04 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> YES YOU ARE YOU ARE ON THE MONEY WITH THAT COMPLETELY
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 205.99 206.95 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> NO IT IS
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 209.95 210.74 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> AGREED
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 212.28 215.88 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> NO YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT THERE (I-) THERE IS AN OVER RELIANCE
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 215.92 223.43 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> (I-) IN MANY WAYS THERE IS AN OVER RELIANCE ON THE CONVENIENCE FACTOR OF TECHNOLOGY AND I THINK THAT IS A A VERY VALID ARGUMENT
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 223.91 226.07 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> IT IS A DIFFICULT ONE BECAUSE YOU COULD LOOK AT IT
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 226.49 227.96 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> NOT JUST FROM
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 228.04 232.44 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> COMPUTERS STANDPOINT BUT FROM ELECTRONICS NOT EVEN ELECTRONICS IN GENERAL BUT
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 232.58 234.17 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> ANY TOOLS THAT WE USED
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 234.51 235.86 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> UNFORTUNATELY
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 236.05 241.45 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> OUR WHOLE FOUNDATION OF SOCIETY HAS BEEN DRIVEN MORE TOWARDS A CONVENIENCE ORIENTED
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 241.47 247.02 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> SOCIETY AND YOU ARE RIGHT THERE IS AN OVER RELIANCE OF PEOPLE ON MACHINES TO
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 247.1 248.94 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> DO THE WORK AND THINK FOR US
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 249.34 254.53 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> IT IS A CURIOUS MIX AND I AGREE WITH YOU COMPLETELY IT IS FRIGHTENING WHEN YOU WALK INTO A STORE AND
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 255.07 259.24 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> YOU KNOW YOU HAVE GOT A A CASHIER AT A CASH REGISTER WHO IS SCANNING ITEMS ACROSS
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 259.3 260.57 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> ON A BAR CODE SCANNER
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 261.18 265.74 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> AND YOU KNOW NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT THE INDIVIDUAL PRICES ARE IF THE MACHINE MAKES A MISTAKE
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 265.97 267.85 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> THE CUSTOMER IS THE ONE WHO PAYS AND
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 268.18 271.94 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> ALSO AND WHEN IT COMES TIME TO GET YOUR CHANGE YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT (%HESITATION) IT
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 272.05 275.32 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> PEOPLE CANNOT NECESSARILY ALWAYS COUNT TO MAKE CHANGE
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 275.87 280.48 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> THEY HAVE TO RELY ON WHAT THE MACHINE TELLS THEM SO YEAH THAT IS A REALLY VALID ARGUMENT I THINK YOU MADE
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 280.52 281.87 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> AND IT IS A GOOD IT IS A GOOD
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 282.91 284.79 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> YEAH IT IS A IT IS A REALLY GOOD POINT
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 291.01 293.92 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR>
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 295.97 296.38 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> (%HESITATION)
fsh_60571 A fsh_60571_A 318.51 319.81 <O,FI,M,CELLULAR> RIGHT I UNDERSTAND
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 36.42 38.23 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> I HAVE (%HESITATION) I AM A
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 38.43 42.78 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> BUSINESS GRADUATE FROM (%HESITATION) UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON BUT WHEN I STARTED I WAS IN ENGINEERING
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 43.06 46.08 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> AND I KNOW THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT USED TO
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 46.69 48.31 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> MAKE ME MAD ON TESTS
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 48.97 50.93 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> WAS THAT YOU HAD TO MEMORIZE FORMULAS
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 52.04 55.57 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> AND SO I I THOUGHT THAT WAS KIND OF SILLY BECAUSE IF YOU WERE DOING A JOB
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 55.73 59.5 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> YOU WOULD HAVE THE FORMULAS WELL I I FEEL MUCH THE SAME ABOUT COMPUTERS
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 60.24 62.88 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> I HAVE HEARD SOME FOLKS SAY YOU KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 63.06 65.45 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> THEY KIND OF (%HESITATION) TAKE THE THINKING AWAY FOR YOU
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 66.19 70.66 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> BUT FOR ME IT IS A TOOL SO THAT IS KIND OF WHAT I THINK ABOUT IT I GUESS (%HESITATION) SO IT IS GOOD
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 80.14 80.58 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> (%HESITATION)
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 114.85 115.71 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> YEAH I
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 123.38 124.12 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> FOR SURE
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 156.84 161.12 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> WELL IT SOUND LIKE YOU AND I ARE IN AGREEMENT MAYBE I WILL THROW IN A DEVIL'S ADVOCATE THING
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 161.6 167.1 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> AND AND THIS HAPPENED IN THE METROPLEX I USED TO BE THE PERSONNEL MANAGER FOR (%HESITATION) WINN DIXIE UP THERE
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 167.39 169.46 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> YEAH I WOULD TRAIN A LOT OF GROCERY CHECKERS AND ALL
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 170.14 173.37 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> AND HAVE YOU HEARD AND MAYBE YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY I KNOW I DO
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 173.7 175.26 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> SOMETIMES THE KIDS
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 176.14 177.5 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> CANNOT GIVE CHANGE
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 178.32 180.49 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> (%HESITATION) IF THE MACHINE IS DOWN
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 180.92 184.69 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> BY THAT BY THAT I MEAN THEY ONLY CAN LOOK AT AND SAY WHAT
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 184.9 187.34 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> YEAH YEAH AND SO I WONDER
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 187.58 190.14 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> NOW I AM DOING DEVILS ADVOCATE BUT I I WONDER IF
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 190.37 193.46 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> THE (U-) USE OF COMPUTERS BIG TIME
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 193.86 197.43 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> HAS SOME BAD EFFECT (%HESITATION) ON
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 198.75 200.26 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> THE ABILITY TO REASON
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 201.45 205.47 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> AND I AM KIND OF GOING OUT ON A LIMB HERE I AM NOT SURE WHERE I MEANT WITH THAT THAT STATEMENT BUT
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 205.68 209.65 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> BUT IT DOES KIND OF MAKE YOU FEEL FUNNY WHEN SOMEBODY CANNOT DO CHANGE FOR A DOLLAR
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 209.71 212.72 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> BUT KNOWS THAT IT IS TWENTY-THREE CENTS SO
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 223.14 223.76 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> MHM
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 260.55 261.19 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> MHM
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 280.33 283.4 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> IT DOES IT DOES ALMOST MAKE SENSE DOES NOT IT AND I
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 284.92 287.55 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> I HAVE GOT ANOTHER ONE TO THROW IN THAT MAY YOU KNOW IT IS
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 288.24 290.95 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> YEAH SURE NOW I AM PUMPING UP COLLEGE GRADUATE SHIT AND I HAVE

fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 296.9 300.9 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> SO FOR ME THE THINGS THAT I USED TO KNOW ABOUT ALGEBRA
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 301.43 304.41 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> THAT IS ALL I CAN REALLY THINK OF AT THE MOMENT AS AN EXAMPLE
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 305.02 308.29 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> IT REALLY IS A STRAIN TO GET BACK AND DO
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 308.95 309.6 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> (%HESITATION)
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 310.93 314.81 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> WHAT USED TO BE I KNOW I (R-) REMEMBER WERE FAIRLY SIMPLE
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 315.2 318.15 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> (%HESITATION) TASKS (%HESITATION) MATHEMATICAL IS WHAT I AM SAYING
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 318.6 320.96 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> (%HESITATION) (I-) IT IS LIKE I SORT OF HAVE FORGOTTEN
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 321.08 328.07 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> (%HESITATION) HOW TO DO THOSE THINGS JUST MAINLY BECAUSE I EITHER HAVE NOT USED THEM WHICH KIND OF MUST COMPLICATE THE QUESTION
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 328.54 330.25 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> OR THAT I HAVE FORGOTTEN
fsh_60571 B fsh_60571_B 330.83 333.47 <O,FI,M,CORDLESS> THE FORMULAS AND THOSE THINGS

fsh_60593 A fsh_60593_A 73.21 78.85 <O,FI,F,CELLULAR> WELL AS A TEACHER I HAVE SEEN DECLINING FAMILY MORALS OVER THE LAST TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AND
fsh_60593 A fsh_60593_A 78.87 82.4 <O,FI,F,CELLULAR> IT IS REALLY PRETTY SCARY I (%HESITATION) (%HESITATION)
fsh_60593 A fsh_60593_A 82.68 88.83 <O,FI,F,CELLULAR> SEE THE THE DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGES CAUSING CHILDREN TO HAVE PROBLEMS AND

fsh_60593 A fsh_60593_A 91.93 95.83 <O,FI,F,CELLULAR> AND ALL OF THIS HAS SUCH A A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON CHILDREN
fsh_60593 A fsh_60593_A 95.9 100.06 <O,FI,F,CELLULAR> THAT I HAVE ALSO TAKEN A JOB AFTER SCHOOL THESE DAYS AS
fsh_60593 A fsh_60593_A 100.14 106.02 <O,FI,F,CELLULAR> A COORDINATOR FOR A GROUP OF CHILDREN WHO ARE AT RISK SOCIALLY AND ACADEMICALLY
fsh_60593 A fsh_60593_A 106.58 112.13 <O,FI,F,CELLULAR> AND WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO WITH THEM IS INSTILL SOME MORAL VALUES WITH THEM ALSO
